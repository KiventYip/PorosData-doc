**Data Sovereignty and Academic Integrity Declaration**

In the era of AI for Science, data is no longer merely an information carrier, but the foundation of academic discourse. PorosData upholds the principle of "academic atomicity": every piece of data carries indivisible academic value, and we are committed to protecting the atomic integrity of mathematical formulas, citation systems, and scientific semantics throughout the data refinement process.

This atomicity guarantee ensures:
- **Semantic Fidelity**: Mathematical expressions never become distorted, citation chains never break
- **Traceability**: Every cleaning decision has clear academic justification
- **Extensibility**: New components and plugins seamlessly integrate atomicity contracts

We believe that true AI for Science is not only technological innovation, but also the inheritance of academic tradition.
